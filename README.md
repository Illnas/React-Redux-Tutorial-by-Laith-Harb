React Redux Tutorial by Laith Harb

I had this problem for quite some time after learning how to make functional components
in React and how to use Hooks, and that is, what is the purpose of state managment  libraries?
After failing to learn MobX in time to finish project that was a prerequisite for further advancement
in the hiring process, I decided to learn Redux first, then MobX properly and see the why are they needed!

And I was kinda suprised! In this tutorial done by Laith Harb, he introduces you to logic behind
Redux and gives you an example. And as someone, who had to pass a lot of states as props in project
I did as a requirement for a hiring process, I was amazed at the "store" concept! It is quite amazing,
that I learn more by failing to do a project as required by a hiring process than I do when I finish 
projects myself!

Well, gonna do one more redux tutorial tomorrow. And then I will start with simple
introduction into each and every hook React has. And then start with those React projects 
from freeCodeCamp blog.
